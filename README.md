# Online Travel Reservation

> Project for Graduate software engineering course Enterprise Distributed Systems.

## Goal

- The goal is to build a distributed enterprise web application which enables the user not only to search for Cars, Hotels and Flights and make a booking but also login/signup along with editing user preferences and viewing travel history.

- I was tasked with this project requirement so that we can learn and develop enterprise MERN stack applications with the use of distributed publish-subscribe messaging system like Apache Kafka along with a variety of other technologies like redis, mocha, etc.

## System Design
